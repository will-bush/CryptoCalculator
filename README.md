A simple Cryptocurrency Portfolio Calculator App built using a Rails backend and a React.js frontend. Data is fetched from the CoinMarketCap API, and styling uses Semantic UI. The app allows a user to search from over 1,300 different assets, specify the size of their holding, and view the value of that asset as well as the total value of their portfolio.
